# Guide: Casino Bot

Interacting with the bot  
The bot uses slash commands (e.g. ) and pinging with @ Gamble Bot.

Each slash command shows the options you can pass to them, with some being required and some being optional.

How to play  
To play with the bot, use any of the game commands (see the COMMANDS tab for the list)

Players start with 1,000 cash and level 0.

The bot uses a global economy so you can play in any server using the same profile.

Most (soon to be all) games support betting your hard earned cash, with an allin option to bet all your cash in the hopes to win big!

There's no level cap so you can play endlessly and nobody can be at the top of any leaderboard 'forever' (provided you don't hit the database cap... heh)

Play games, win cash, get to the top of the leaderboards!

Server and player perks can be purchased by donating to give you and/or your server an edge against the competition!

Every command in the bot has a help page. Call  <name of command> (e.g.  blackjack) to see the page, it will show any aliases that you can use when pinging with @ Gamble Bot and some examples of how to use the command. You can also @ Gamble Bot help blackjack

Note: the help is currently tailored for the @ Gamble Bot ping variation as opposed to slash commands but there's no difference between either option so choose which you prefer. If you see any mentions of $someCommand just calling @ Gamble Bot someCommand instead will work (e.g. @ Gamble Bot replaced the old prefix of $ which is no longer supported)

Understanding the command help  
To view all the available commands, you can call 
@ Gamble Bot help
@ Gamble Bot h

The help is linked to the COMMANDS tab on this website which is searchable and easier to use than 
@ Gamble Bot help
@ Gamble Bot h

Commands look like this in the help:

@ Gamble Bot commandName <bet> [hard]
@ Gamble Bot commandName <bet> [<optionalBet>]
Arguments wrapped in [] are optional. Anything not wrapped in these must be passed in for the command to work.

Arguments wrapped in <> are where you can pass a value in, e.g. <bet> would be where you put 1000

In the case where you have [hard | h] this indicates an optional hard mode for the game with slightly increased difficulty in exchange for better odds.

Slash commands assist in this and tell you whether the argument is optional and, if it has a fixed number of choices, will present you with those choices (e.g. you will be able to choose Easy or Hard mode for the hard argument)

For example:

@ Gamble Bot blackjack <bet> [hard | h]
You could call:

@ Gamble Bot blackjack 100
@ Gamble Bot blackjack 100 hard
@ Gamble Bot blackjack 100 h

In some cases, arguments are required as strings:

@ Gamble Bot coinFlip <heads|tails> <bet>
In this case, you can use:

@ Gamble Bot coinFlip heads 100
@ Gamble Bot coinFlip tails 100

Every command help page has examples that show the various different ways to use the command.

Bets and number arguments  
All of the games in the bot support the same values for bets, as well as the shop and any other command that expects a number as an argument (like ).

You can bet using max (or m) to bet your Betting Maximum indicated by  You can also buy the maximum number of an item that you can afford, or sell the number of an item that you have using max or m as the count.

If you have less than your betting allowance, it will use all your current cash.

When betting, you can add the following letters after your bet as a shortcut for large numbers.

E.g. 1k = 1,000  
y  = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000  
z  = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000  
e  = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000  
p  = 1,000,000,000,000,000  
t  = 1,000,000,000,000  
g  = 1,000,000,000  
m  = 1,000,000  
k  = 1,000  

All games and commands expect numbers as whole, positive numbers.

Fractional numbers will be rounded down.

Earning money  
Cash Commands  
The simplest way to earn money in the bot is via the various cash commands.

You can call  @ Gamble Bot daily to get some cash every 10 minutes, and  @ Gamble Bot monthly every day (resets at midnight regardless of when you called it)

Donators can get access to  @ Gamble Bot weekly as well as @ Gamble Bot overtime, @ Gamble Bot yearly and @ Gamble Bot godlike

You can see the commands you have access to as well as when they are ready on  @ Gamble Bot cooldowns (/c)

Voting  
If you don't mind watching a few ads, you can vote for the bot to get 100,000 x your player level.

Voting consecutively without a gap of more than 48 hours between votes will increase the multiplier.

Each 21st vote will be a 3x multipler, which stacks with your streak multipler.

Assuming you are level 1, the following cash reward table shows what you could receive by chaining votes:

Vote Number	Multipler	Reward
1-20	1x	100,000
21	3x	300,000
22 - 41	2x	200,000
42	6x	600,000
43 - 62	3x	300,000
63	9x	900,000
64 - 83	4x	400,000
84	12x	1,200,000

If you vote on all 3 links every 12 hours, you can get 21 votes every 3.5 days. Voting on all three links once per day will take a week.

At level one voting every 12h, you could earn 23,000,000, level 2 would be 46,000,000 and so on!

top.gg also offers double votes on weekends for bot votes (Friday - Sunday). As they offer double votes, the bot offers double rewards.

This means that if you voted for the bot using top.gg on the weekend for your 84th vote, you could get a 24x multiplier!

Time your top.gg bot votes on weekends and you can make a large amount of money reasonably quickly!

Lotto  
A weekly lottery runs in the bot and is drawn at 11:00 Saturdays (London Time).

The starting value is 1,000,000 which is set immediately after the draw.

Every player can buy 1,000 tickets (each costing 1,000). Every ticket purchased increases the prize pot by 50,000

Buy tickets with @ Gamble Bot lotto X - As with all buy commands you can use max or a number to select the amount to buy.

When the draw is complete, the winner is posted in #lottery on the support server and sent a DM to tell them the winnings (you need the 'Allow direct messages from server members' enabled for this to work)

Earning XP  
XP can be earned two ways:

Winning gambles  
Earning Achievements  
Each gamble win provides your winning cash, as well as an amount of XP. This differs for each game, although most currently give 100 per win.

You can see your current XP and player level with @ Gamble Bot me

Achievements also exist to bolster your XP and are the fastest way to get it. There are achievements for gambling, earning cash and buying/finding items.

You can see your achievements with @ Gamble Bot lookup achievements and item achievements with @ Gamble Bot lookup achievements items

Each achievement has a current well as a progress bar indicating your percentage to the target.

Every achievement earned grants 100xp. Generally these come in one at a time but when placing large bets with allIn it's common to get several achievements at once (e.g for cash earned).

Gamble Bot has a leaderboard for everything. Gambling, items, mining, you name it there's a leaderboard.
